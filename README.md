MATLAB Simulation of Linearity Property in Biomedical Signals

This project demonstrates the linearity property of systems using simulated biomedical signals in MATLAB. The goal is to show, in a simple and visual way, how linear systems obey the principles of additivity and homogeneity, which are fundamental in biomedical signal processing.


What this project shows
In theory, a system is linear if it satisfies:

 1.Additivity
If input x1(t) produces output y1(t) and x2(t) produces y2(t), then
x1(t) + x2(t) should produce y1(t) + y2(t).

2. Homogeneity (Scaling)
If input x(t) produces output y(t), then
a · x(t) should produce a · y(t).

This simulation verifies these properties using signals that resemble biomedical waveforms.

Signals used
  1. Sinusoidal signals representing simplified biomedical signals (similar to ECG or EMG components) 
  2. Linear time-invariant (LTI) system implemented using basic mathematical operations
  3. MATLAB plots to visually compare expected and actual outputs


Applications in biomedical engineering

  1.Understanding ECG, EEG, and EMG signal processing
  2.Designing and validating biomedical filters
  3.Teaching core concepts in Signals and Systems
  4.Pre-processing and analysis of physiological data

Requirements
   1. MATLAB (any recent version)
   2. Basic knowledge of Signals and Systems
